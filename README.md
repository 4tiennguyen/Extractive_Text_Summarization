# Extractive Text Summarization
In the digital age, we have access to a lot of online information. However, reading all of it takes time. Text summarization can help by shortening the text while still keeping important information. Our project uses fuzzy logic and a neural network to extract key sentences. Specifically, we use neural networks to determine the optimal weights for aggregating different feature scores that indicate the importance of sentences in the BBC dataset. The final outcome of this project is the creation of a neural network model with appropriate loss and metric functions, which will produce the optimal weights for aggregating various NLP feature scores.
